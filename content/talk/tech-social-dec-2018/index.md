# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Modelling and simulation are increasingly well established techniques in a wide range of academic and industrial domains. As their use becomes increasingly important it is vital that we understand both their sensitivity to inputs and how much confidence we should have in their results. Nonetheless, few simulations are reported with rigorous validation (V) and verification (V), or even meaningful error bars (uncertainty quantification - UQ). Our answer to this issue is EasyVVUQ, a Python library designed to make it easy to apply a range of VVUQ techniques to your existing simulation workflows. We are presenting EasyVVUQ in its early stages and are actively looking for feedback on our approaches and potential use cases with which to test it.."
