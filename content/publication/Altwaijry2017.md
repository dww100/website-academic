abstract = "The accurate identification of the specific points of interaction between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomers is essential for the design of receptor ligands targeting oligomeric receptor targets. A coarse-grained molecular dynamics computer simulation approach would provide a compelling means of identifying these specific protein–protein interactions and could be applied both for known oligomers of interest and as a high-throughput screen to identify novel oligomeric targets. However, to be effective, this in silico modeling must provide accurate, precise, and reproducible information. This has been achieved recently in numerous biological systems using an ensemble-based all-atom molecular dynamics approach. In this study, we describe an equivalent methodology for ensemble-based coarse-grained simulations. We report the performance of this method when applied to four different GPCRs known to oligomerize using error analysis to determine the ensemble size and individual replica simulation time req..."
