abstract = "We describe a general method to use Monte Carlo simulation followed by torsion-angle molecular dynamics simulations to create ensembles of structures to model a wide variety of soft-matter biological systems. Our particular emphasis is focused on modeling low-resolution small-angle scattering and reflectivity structural data. We provide examples of this method applied to HIV-1 Gag protein and derived fragment proteins, TraI protein, linear B-DNA, a nucleosome core particle, and a glycosylated monoclonal antibody. This procedure will enable a large community of researchers to model low-resolution experimental data with greater accuracy by using robust physics based simulation and sampling methods which are a significant improvement over traditional methods used to interpret such data."
