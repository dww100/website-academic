abstract = "The accurate prediction of the binding affinities of ligands to proteins is a major goal in drug discovery and personalized medicine. The time taken to make such predictions is of similar importance to their accuracy, precision, and reliability. In the past few years, an ensemble based molecular dynamics approach has been proposed that provides a route to reliable predictions of free energies based on the molecular mechanics Poissonâ€“Boltzmann surface area method which meets the requirements of speed, accuracy, precision, and reliability. Here, we describe an equivalent methodology based on thermodynamic integration to substantially improve the speed, accuracy, precision, and reliability of calculated relative binding free energies. We report the performance of the method when applied to a diverse set of protein targets and ligands. The results are in very good agreement with experimental data (90% of calculations agree to within 1 kcal/mol), while the method is reproducible by construction. Statistical un..."
