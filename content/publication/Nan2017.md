abstract = "The lectin pathway of complement is activated by complexes comprising a recognition component (mannose-binding lectin, serum ficolins, collectin-LK or collectin-K1) and a serine protease (MASP-1 or MASP-2). MASP-1 activates MASP-2, and MASP-2 cleaves C4 and C4b-bound C2. To clarify activation, new crystal structures of Ca2+-bound MASP dimers were determined, together with their solution structures from X-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and atomistic modeling. Solution structures of the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 dimer of each MASP indicate that the two CUB2 domains were tilted by as much as 90Â° compared with the crystal structures, indicating considerable flexibility at the EGF-CUB2 junction. Solution structures of the full-length MASP dimers in their zymogen and activated forms revealed similar structures that were much more bent than anticipated from crystal structures. We conclude that MASP-1 and MASP-2 are flexible at multiple sites and that this flexibility may permit both intra- and inter-complex activation."
